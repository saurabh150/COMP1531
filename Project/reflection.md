# Reflection

## What was good
Our team structured and organised our tasks well by having a todo list at the beginning and assigning different team members to the tasks. Our communication was also good as we all actively participated and were quick to check our Facebook messenger team chat. 
We also had standups on the Tuesday and Saturday before iteration 1 was due. We organised who was responsible for which parts and helped each other progress on the Tuesday standup. On the Saturday one we updated each other with what we were all up to, redistributed work and helped each other out.
When we had disagreements (for example when Jiamin and Jason disagreed on naming conventions) we discussed it thoroughly first before implementing one of them instead of doing whatever an individual felt like doing.
We were able to give each other tips and help for whatever problems we came across. This helped us acheive more as a team than we could have individually in a much shorter amount of time.

## What could have been better
We could have started earlier and planned our team meetings better. We should have a more structured call with our agenda and direction clearly listed so that we have shorter and more concise calls. We were also very confused about our requirements and did not have a style format that we all followed. We will improve for the next iteration by clearly planning our schedule as well as developing a better understanding of the specifications prior to starting to code. We will try to use the piazza forum more when we are confused/have questions instead of dwelling on it and trying to come to a conclusion ourselves. We will also improve our teamwork as we are now more comfortable with how we work with each other.
