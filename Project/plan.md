# Communication
* 2 x (stand ups + 1 hour per week)
* Regarding importance of functions: On the Gantt chart we placed the functions in terms of relative importance to ensure functions that are used repetitively and relied on more are done first 
* Discussing disagreements before implementations and critiquing work EVERY CALL
* Regular weekly todo lists with assignments gave us a very good outline of what the current workload for the weeks was. Eg. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D238YWOdpt_ESuduWTL6pW_fvgNrPWd6KEJqa0jTE2I/edit#gid=1386834576
* We will stick with the time plan as outlined in our Gantt chart https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KY05gdqUoEu1ZF0ukWhraRTrCohT3ali3DxcxDuWp44/edit?usp=sharing
* We will be using google hangouts for standups
* We will continue to use git as versioning software
* We will use pytest to test our functions
